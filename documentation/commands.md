1. `node js/application certificate`
   - By default a certificate authority (CA) certificate is created.
1. `node js/application certificate /file/path/to/save`

   - The file name of the certificate and supporting files. The default value is "share-file" if no name is provided.
1. `node js/application certificate domain:"localhost"`
   - Specify a certificate domain by providing an argument beginning 'domain:'. This is optional in create mode and defaults to "share-file". This argument is required in remove mode on Windows as only certificates with a matching domain will be removed.
1. `node js/application certificate organization:"localhost"`
   - Specify a certificate org value by providing an argument beginning 'organization:'. This is optional in create mode and defaults to "share-file". This argument is required in remove mode on Windows as certificates with a matching org value will be removed.

### Examples
1. `node js/application directory source:"my/directory/path"`
   - Returns an array where each index is an array of [absolute path, type, parent index, file count, stat]. Type can refer to 'file', 'directory', or 'link' for symbolic links.  The parent index identify which index in the array is the objects containing directory and the file count is the number of objects a directory type object contains.
1. `node js/application directory source:"my/directory/path" depth:9`

   - Returns a JSON string of an object where each file, in absolutely path, is a key name and its hash is the key's value.
1. `node js/application hash file/system/path algorithm:sha3-512`
   - The algorithm argument allows a choice of hashing algorithm. Supported values: 'blake2d512', 'blake2s256', 'sha3-224', 'sha3-256', 'sha3-384', 'sha3-512', 'sha384', 'sha512', 'sha512-224', 'sha512-256', 'shake128', 'shake256'

## lint

1. `node js/application lint ../tools ignore [node_modules, .git, test, units]`
   - An ignore list is also accepted if there is a list wrapped in square braces following the word 'ignore'.

## mkdir
Recursively creates a directory structure.  For example if 'my/new/path` were to be created but parent 'my' doesn't exist this command will create all three directories, but it will not alter or overwrite any artifacts already present. Relative paths are relative to the terminal's current working directory.

### Examples
1. `node js/application mkdir my/path/to/create`
   - This example would create directories as necessary to ensure the directory structure 'my/path/to/create' is available from the location relative to the terminal's current working directory.

## remove

### Examples
1. `node js/application remove path/to/resource`
   - Removes the specified resource.
1. `node js/application remove "C:\Program Files"`
   - Quote the path if it contains non-alphanumeric characters.

## service
Launches a HTTP service and web sockets so that the web tool is automatically refreshed once code changes in the local file system.

### Examples
1. `node js/application service`
   - Launches the service on default port 443 (80 insecure) and web sockets on port 444 (81 insecure).
1. `node js/application service 8080`
   - If a numeric argument is supplied the web service starts on the port specified and web sockets on the following port.
1. `node js/application service 0`
   - To receive a random available port specify port number 0.
1. `node js/application service browser`
   - The 'browser' argument launches the default location in the user's default web browser.
1. `node js/application service test`
   - The 'test' argument tells the service to use data from a separate settings location for running tests instead of the user's actual data.
1. `node js/application service test browser 9000`
   - An example with all supported arguments.  The supported arguments may occur in any order, but the third argument (after 'browser' and 'test') must be a number.
1. `node js/application service ip:192.168.1.125`
   - An argument that begins with 'ip:' forces use of the specified IP address.
1. `node js/application service secure`
   - The 'secure' argument forces the service to use secure protocols: HTTPS and WSS.
1. `node js/application service insecure`
   - The 'insecure' argument forces the service to use insecure protocols: HTTP and WS.

## test
Builds the application and then runs all the test commands

### Examples
1. `node js/application test`
   - Runs all the tests in the test suite.

## test_browser
Launches the 'service' command as a child process, launches the default browser to execute DOM instructions as intervals of test automation, and then closes the browser upon completion.

### Examples
1. `node js/application test_browser`
   - Runs the browser interaction tests.
1. `node js/application test_browser no_close`
   - Disables the 'window.close()' command at the end of test instructions so that the browser remains open for manual inspection.
1. `node js/application test_browser demo`
   - Same as the 'no_close' argument but also imposes a half second delay between actions so that a person can watch the interactions.
1. `node js/application test_browser mode:"self"`
   - The mode parameter determines what tests to execute. The value 'self', the default value, only execute tests using the local computer.
1. `node js/application test_browser mode:"device"`
   - The value 'device' executes tests requiring additional computers that are 'device' type and not 'user' type. This mode requires 4 other computers executing in mode 'remote'.
1. `node js/application test_browser mode:"user"`
   - The value 'user' executes tests requiring additional computers that are 'device' and 'user' types. This mode requires 4 other computers executing in mode 'remote'.
1. `node js/application test_browser mode:"remote"`
   - The value 'remote' puts a computer into listening mode awaiting instructions from a computer executing 'agents' tests. Computers in this mode will not exit the service automatically.
1. `node js/application test_browser "C:\Program Files\Mozilla Firefox\firefox.exe" no_close`
   - By default tests only execute against the default browser.  To test against other locally installed browsers simply provide the absolute path to the browser binary.

## test_service
Launches the 'service' command as a child process to issue HTTP requests against it and test the results

### Examples
1. `node js/application test_service`
   - Runs tests service utility.
1. `node js/application test_service fs-copy`
   - Filter the tests to run by supplying a text fragment to filter against test names.  For example if there are 6 service tests whose names contain that string then only those 6 tests will be evaluated.
1. `node js/application test_service "Copy from Remote Device to different Remote Device"`
   - Using quotes the filter argument may contain spaces and other non-alpha characters.

## test_simulation
Launches a test runner to execute the various commands of the services file.

### Examples
1. `node js/application test_simulation`
   - Runs tests against the commands offered by the services file.
1. `node js/application test_simulation help`
   - Filter the tests to run by supplying a text fragment to filter against test names.  For example if there are 6 service tests whose names contain that string then only those 6 tests will be evaluated.
1. `node js/application test_simulation "hash ~/share-file-systems list ignore ['node_modules'"`
   - Using quotes the filter argument may contain spaces and other non-alpha characters.

## update
Pulls code from the git repository of the current git remote and branch, rebuilds the application, then executes a command. The child command will always execute from the project's absolute directory.

### Examples
1. `node js/application update`
   - If no additional arguments are provided the child command to execute will be: node js/application service
1. `node js/application update test_browser`
   - The child command will be: node js/application test_browser
1. `node js/application update lint ../tools ignore [node_modules, .git, test, units]`
   - All arguments are passed into the child command equivalent to: node js/application lint ../tools ignore [node_modules, .git, test, units]

## version
Prints the current version number and date of prior modification to the console.

### Examples
1. `node js/application version`
   - Prints the current version number and date to the shell.
